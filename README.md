# Grecian-Computer
My Python solution to brute forcing the "Grecian Computer" puzzle by the Happy Puzzle Company.

First, I had to transcribe all the numbers on the dial to dials.py. I then worked on an algorithm to check for overlaps and add the sum of a column. Finally, I used brute force to find the solution (shown below).
